This code demonstrates tokenization, normalization, and stop word removal – the backbone of NLP!

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):
✅ The go-to library for NLP tasks like tokenization, stop word removal, and more.
✅ Uses specific resources like punkt (for tokenization) and stopwords (for stop word removal).

Pro Tips: 
✅ Pre-download NLTK resources once, and you’re good to go!
✅ If you want to avoid NLTK altogether, you can use spaCy, a modern NLP library that does not require separate downloads for basic resources.
